# Week 7 Assignment: Crawling and Scraping the Web
For this assignment, we tested the web scraping abilities of Go on ten wikipedia pages. We used the Colly package instead of the net/http package in the Go standard library. Our goal was to get results that were similar to the Scrapy program in Python, which we succeeded at. It took the Scrapy program 15.77 seconds to retrieve all ten websites, but it only took 0.236 seconds to accomplish the same task. Our deliverable was a JSON lines file (output.jl) which is created in the same directory as the main.go file.

## Background
This assignment used the [Colly Package](https://github.com/gocolly/colly), which is a batteries-included web scraping package for Go.

For the python portion of the assignment, we used the example provided on Canvas for Scrapy but added timing information. The example can be found [here](https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/231183/pages/python-slash-scrapy-wikipedia-example?wrap=1).
